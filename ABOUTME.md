# About Me

## Name
Nishant Patel

## About

I am a [student / developer] who is passionate about building things
and learning by doing. This project is a good example of how I work —
I start with a problem, figure out the right tools, debug issues as
they come up, and don't stop until it's working and live.

Through building this project I learned about full-stack architecture,
REST APIs, LLM integration, content extraction, database design, and
deploying applications on Render and Vercel.

I am currently learning web development and looking for opportunities
where I can contribute, grow, and keep building.
